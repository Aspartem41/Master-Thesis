# Development of Synthetic Load Profiles for University Buildings
### ðŸ“˜ Masterâ€™s Thesis â€“ Hochschule Nordhausen

This repository contains the implementation, documentation, and results of my Masterâ€™s thesis:
**"Development of Synthetic Load Profiles for University Buildings: A Case Study of Nordhausen University of Applied Sciences."**

## ðŸ“‰ Overview

The goal of this project is to model realistic electricity consumption behaviours for university buildings, taking into account academic periods, equipment usage, occupancy behaviour, and seasonal variations. The RAMP simulation tool was adapted and extended to generate stochastic, high-resolution synthetic load profiles.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Develop synthetic load profiles using the RAMP tool.
- Categorise building types and room functions.
- Analyse and simulate equipment usage across academic periods.
- Validate model results using historical consumption data.
- Propose energy management strategies to support sustainability on campus.

---

## ðŸ”§ Methodology

- Room and building categorisation based on functions.
- Equipment profiling using a structured OneNote-based documentation system.
- Simulation of electricity demand using adapted RAMP models.
- Base load estimation and integration.
- Validation against historical energy usage data (2011â€“2023).
- Ventilation modelling based on seasonal temperature profiles.
